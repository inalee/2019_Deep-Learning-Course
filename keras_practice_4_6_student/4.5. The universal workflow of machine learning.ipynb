    "## 4.5.1. Defining the problem and assembling a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### First, you must define the problem at hand (먼저 주어진 문제를 정의해야 함):\n",
    "\n",
    "- What will your input data be? What are you trying to predict? You can only learn to predict something if you have available training data: for example, you can only learn to classify the sentiment of movie reviews if you have both movie reviews and sentiment annotations available. As such, data availability is usually the limiting factor at this stage (unless you have the means to pay people to collect data for you).\n",
    "\n",
    "- What type of problem are you facing? Is it binary classification? Multiclass classification? Scalar regression? Vector regression? Multiclass, multilabel classification? Something else, like clustering, generation, or reinforcement learning? Identifying the problem type will guide your choice of model architecture, loss function, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You can’t move to the next stage until you know what your inputs and outputs are, and what data you’ll use. Be aware of the hypotheses you make at this stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You hypothesize that your outputs can be predicted given your inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You hypothesize that your available data is sufficiently informative to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until you have a working model, these are merely hypotheses, waiting to be validated or invalidated. Not all problems can be solved; just because you’ve assembled examples of inputs X and targets Y doesn’t mean X contains enough information to predict Y. For instance, if you’re trying to predict the movements of a stock on the stock market given its recent price history, you’re unlikely to succeed, because price history doesn’t contain much predictive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One class of unsolvable problems you should be aware of is nonstationary problems. Suppose you’re trying to build a recommendation engine for clothing, you’re training it on one month of data (August), and you want to start generating recommendations in the winter. One big issue is that the kinds of clothes people buy change from season to season: clothes buying is a nonstationary phenomenon over the scale of a few months. What you’re trying to model changes over time. In this case, the right move is to constantly retrain your model on data from the recent past, or gather data at a timescale where the problem is stationary. For a cyclical problem like clothes buying, a few years’ worth of data will suffice to capture seasonal variation—but remember to make the time of the year an input of your model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that machine learning can only be used to memorize patterns that are present in your training data. You can only recognize what you’ve seen before. Using machine learning trained on past data to predict the future is making the assumption that the future will behave like the past. That often isn’t the case."

    "## 4.5.2. Choosing a measure of success\n",
    "\n",
    "To control something, you need to be able to observe it. To achieve success, you must define what you mean by success—accuracy? Precision and recall? Customer-retention rate? Your metric for success will guide the choice of a loss function: what your model will optimize. It should directly align with your higher-level goals, such as the success of your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "For balanced-classification problems, where every class is equally likely, accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) are common metrics. For class-imbalanced problems, you can use precision and recall. For ranking problems or multilabel classification, you can use mean average precision. And it isn’t uncommon to have to define your own custom metric by which to measure success. To get a sense of the diversity of machine-learning success metrics and how they relate to different problem domains, it’s helpful to browse the data science competitions on Kaggle (https://kaggle.com); they showcase a wide range of problems and evaluation metrics."

    "### 4.5.5. Developing a model that does better than a baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal at this stage is to achieve statistical power: that is, to develop a small model that is capable of beating a dumb baseline. In the MNIST digit-classification example, anything that achieves an accuracy greater than 0.1 can be said to have statistical power; in the IMDB example, it’s anything with an accuracy greater than 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it’s not always possible to achieve statistical power. If you can’t beat a random baseline after trying multiple reasonable architectures, it may be that the answer to the question you’re asking isn’t present in the input data. Remember that you make two hypotheses:\n",

    "\n",
    "Assuming that things go well, you need to make three key choices to build your first working model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Last-layer activation— This establishes useful constraints on the network’s output. For instance, the IMDB classification example used sigmoid in the last layer; the regression example didn’t use any last-layer activation; and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loss function— This should match the type of problem you’re trying to solve. For instance, the IMDB example used binary_crossentropy, the regression example used mse, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimization configuration— What optimizer will you use? What will its learning rate be? In most cases, it’s safe to go with rmsprop and its default learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the choice of a loss function, note that it isn’t always possible to directly optimize for the metric that measures success on a problem. Sometimes there is no easy way to turn a metric into a loss function; loss functions, after all, need to be computable given only a mini-batch of data (ideally, a loss function should be computable for as little as a single data point) and must be differentiable (otherwise, you can’t use backpropagation to train your network). For instance, the widely used classification metric ROC AUC can’t be directly optimized. Hence, in classification tasks, it’s common to optimize for a proxy metric of ROC AUC, such as crossentropy. In general, you can hope that the lower the crossentropy gets, the higher the ROC AUC will be.\n",

    "Table 4.1 can help you choose a last-layer activation and a loss function for a few common problem types."

    "### 4.5.6. Scaling up: developing a model that overfits\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve obtained a model that has statistical power, the question becomes, is your model sufficiently powerful? Does it have enough layers and parameters to properly model the problem at hand? For instance, a network with a single hidden layer with two units would have statistical power on MNIST but wouldn’t be sufficient to solve the problem well. Remember that the universal tension in machine learning is between optimization and generalization; the ideal model is one that stands right at the border between underfitting and overfitting; between undercapacity and overcapacity. To figure out where this border lies, first you must cross it.\n",

    "To figure out how big a model you’ll need, you must develop a model that overfits. This is fairly easy:\n",

    "### 4.5.7. Regularizing your model and tuning your hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This step will take the most time: you’ll repeatedly modify your model, train it, evaluate on your validation data (not the test data, at this point), modify it again, and repeat, until the model is as good as it can get. These are some things you should try:\n",

    "\n",
    "Be mindful of the following: every time you use feedback from your validation process to tune your model, you leak information about the validation process into the model. Repeated just a few times, this is innocuous; but done systematically over many iterations, it will eventually cause your model to overfit to the validation process (even though no model is directly trained on any of the validation data). This makes the evaluation process less reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve developed a satisfactory model configuration, you can train your final production model on all the available data (training and validation) and evaluate it one last time on the test set. If it turns out that performance on the test set is significantly worse than the performance measured on the validation data, this may mean either that your validation procedure wasn’t reliable after all, or that you began overfitting to the validation data while tuning the parameters of the model. In this case, you may want to switch to a more reliable evaluation protocol (such as iterated K-fold validation)."
